## The badges.ml story

A few years ago, when I was making extensions for the [Brackets IDE][brackets], I was shocked to learn that
Adobe did not provide **any kind** of download statistics, even to the extension developers.
 
However, I discovered there was an unofficial way to retrieve some statistics by downloading the whole registry,
which is a huge JSON file üìú

```sh
curl https://brackets-registry.aboutweb.com/registryList -H "Accept: application/json" -k
```

Not only I wanted stats, but I wanted badges, and I wanted other people to have them too. That's why I created a badge
provider in PHP, and later, another one in Node.js. There was a lot of [crappy code][beb], but it worked quite well.

When I heard about [Badgen][badgen] for the first time, I immediately knew it could replace my badge
provider efficiently, provide both classic and flat badges, as well as a JSON API.

However, the role of Badgen is to *generate badges*, not to *download / parse / save* the brackets 
registry, so I forked the [Badgen Service][badgen-service], transformed it into [`badges.ml`][badges.ml], and
hosted it on [Now][now].


## Retro-compatibility

This new badge provider is still retro-compatible with the old badge provider URLs:
 
|                    Old URL                   |             New URL            |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
|`badges.ml/brackets-beautify/day.svg         `|`badges.ml/dd/brackets-beautify`|
|`badges.ml/brackets-beautify/week.svg        `|`badges.ml/dw/brackets-beautify`|
|`badges.ml/brackets-beautify/total.svg       `|`badges.ml/dt/brackets-beautify`|
|`badges.ml/brackets-beautify/last-version.svg`|`badges.ml/dl/brackets-beautify`|
|`badges.ml/brackets-beautify/version.svg     `|`badges.ml/v/brackets-beautify `|
